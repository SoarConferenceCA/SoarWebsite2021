                question: "How does a virtual conference work?",
                answer: "The communication and interactions between attendees will all occur virtually. There will be designated areas created where Delegates will have the opportunity to connect with their Leadership Developers and also communicate with sponsors and executive members. We will provide all the necessary information regarding what platforms to use closer to the conference date."

                question: "Huh? What's a \"Delegate\"?",

                question: "What can I gain from a sponsorship?",
                answer: "At SOAR, sponsorship is a partnership. The PDF on the Sponsors page offers a starting point for compensation. However, we are glad to work with you to meet your needs."

                question: "Can I support SOAR 2022 by any other means, rather than financially?",

                question: "What is an LD?",

                question: "Who can be an LD?",
                answer: "Grade 10, 11, and 12 students across the Peel Region can apply to be a Leadership Developer. If you are in Grade 9, do not worry as there will be opportunities for you in the future."

                question: "What if I've never attended SOAR before?",
